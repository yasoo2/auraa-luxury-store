The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles a journey from initial debugging to significant feature enhancements and persistent CI/CD troubleshooting for the Auraa Luxury e-commerce platform. It began with fixing login issues and hardcoded Arabic text, followed by implementing flexible user registration and a comprehensive Super Admin management page. A key feature was Gregorian to Hijri date conversion, later reverted to Gregorian-only based on user feedback. The most recurring challenge involved CI/CD pipeline failures related to Vercel deployment secrets (, , ),  synchronization, and  dependency conflicts. Concurrently, the engineer addressed an AliExpress scheduler error, a pre-login wishlist counter bug, and is currently debugging an unresponsive logo upload functionality. The approach has been iterative, involving frequent code inspections, edits, service restarts, and detailed communication with the user for clarifications and confirmations, adapting to evolving requirements and technical hurdles.

<product_requirements>
Auraa Luxury is a high-end e-commerce platform with a luxurious, responsive UI, supporting multi-language (Arabic, English, Turkish, Hindi, Hebrew, Spanish, French, Russian, German) and multi-currency, including RTL/LTR. It requires a robust Admin Suite for product/order/user CRUD, analytics, and third-party integrations (e.g., AliExpress dropshipping, GA4, Gmail SMTP). The platform should feature automated CI/CD, a Wishlist, Admin Dashboard (CMS/Media/Theme Customization), legal pages, Customer Order Tracking, and multi-method authentication (Email/Phone/Google/Facebook/Twitter, password reset, delete account, Super Admin management).

Recent user requests and completed implementations:
1.  **Flexible Registration:** Users can register using either email or phone number, or both optionally.
2.  **Super Admin Management Page:** A dedicated admin page for Super Admins to view, manage (change roles, reset passwords, activate/deactivate, delete), and gather statistics on Admin and User accounts. This section should be visible only to Super Admins and prevent the deletion of the last Super Admin. Specific default Super Admin emails (, ) were provided. Deletion and password reset actions require an email/phone confirmation code.
3.  **Date Localization (Reverted):** Initially, automatic conversion of Gregorian dates to Hijri dates when Arabic was selected was implemented and tested. However, the user explicitly requested *all* dates to be Gregorian, removing the Hijri conversion entirely.
4.  **CI/CD Fixes & Enhancements:**
    *   Resolve Vercel deployment failures due to missing GitHub secrets (, , ) and incorrect Vercel CLI usage.
    *   Fix  failure (Resource not accessible by integration) due to GitHub Workflow permissions.
    *   Improve workflow summaries to include deployment status, production URL, and commit ID.
    *   Resolve Unknown command: "error"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm helps during frontend build caused by  sync issues and  dependency conflicts.
    *   Address  errors by disabling the irrelevant  workflow.
5.  **Wishlist Counter Fix:** Correct a bug where the wishlist counter showed 1 even before user login. The counter should only be visible when logged in, and the wishlist should be cleared on logout.
6.  **Unresponsive Logo Upload:** Investigate and fix an issue where the logo upload button on the settings page is unresponsive.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user-reported bug: عند رفع ملف الشعار لا يستجيب (When uploading the logo file, it doesn't respond). The user provided a screenshot which the AI engineer analyzed, confirming that the logo upload button in the settings page (presumably within the Admin Dashboard) is indeed unresponsive. The current step is to investigate the cause of this unresponsiveness by examining the relevant frontend code responsible for the logo upload functionality. This involves identifying the specific component handling the upload, checking its event listeners, API calls, and any associated state management. The engineer is at the very beginning of diagnosing this issue.
