The AI engineer's work in this trajectory can be divided into several phases. Initially, the focus was on critical UI fixes and backend stability, specifically addressing a perceived wishlist issue (which was later found to be due to empty product data) and fixing Admin Dashboard access after login. A significant portion involved responding to an expanded user specification for AliExpress dropshipping integration, which included multi-supplier support, enhanced import/sync logic, and dedicated admin UI elements. A notable deviation occurred where the AI engineer implemented a comprehensive auto-merge and CI/CD GitHub Actions setup, seemingly for internal process improvement, without explicit user instruction in the current feature development cycle. Post-CI/CD, the user requested a review for public launch, leading to the prioritization of essential non-payment related features, specifically legal pages and order tracking. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer actively adding routes for the newly created customer-facing order tracking page.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's request to prepare the store for public launch by fixing all missing elements except the payment gateway. This involved adding crucial customer-facing pages. The AI engineer successfully created the following frontend pages: , , , and . These pages were then integrated into the application's routing by modifying  and were linked from the  component to ensure accessibility. The very last action was the creation of , a new page intended for customers to track their orders. The AI engineer is currently in the process of adding the routing for this  page into . This work follows the successful implementation of Admin Dashboard authentication, a multi-supplier AliExpress import/sync system, and responsive UI enhancements.
