The AI engineer successfully transformed Auraa Luxury from an MVP into a feature-rich e-commerce platform. Initial efforts focused on core scaffolding, UI/UX (logo, carousel, i18n/L10n), and Vercel deployment issues. A major milestone was the creation of a comprehensive Admin Suite (backend CRUD, frontend dashboard pages for products, orders, users, settings, analytics, integrations). User-requested enhancements included advanced shopping features (AI search, smart recommendations, product comparison), and UX improvements (PWA, live chat). The engineer meticulously implemented a full wishlist system with UI integration. The latest work addresses a deployment issue by configuring GitHub Actions for feature branches and is currently focused on enhancing the Admin Products page with a modal-based product form, demonstrating an iterative, user-driven development approach with strong emphasis on testing and feature flagging.
