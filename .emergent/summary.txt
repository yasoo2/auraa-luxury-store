The AI engineer has progressively built out the Auraa Luxury e-commerce application. Initially, the focus was on establishing the core Admin Suite, which involved securing backend product CRUD APIs and developing the foundational frontend dashboard. Key achievements include a fully functional and localized Admin Dashboard with sections for Products, Orders, Users, and Settings, all with dummy data for display. The engineer also implemented comprehensive SEO enhancements, advanced analytics, and external integration placeholders. Subsequently, the development shifted to enhancing the user experience with advanced search filters, smart product recommendations, product comparison, PWA support, and live chat functionality. A critical bug regarding the wishlist feature (heart icon functionality, persistence, and display on the homepage) was identified and successfully resolved. Most recently, efforts addressed deployment issues by adjusting GitHub Actions to work across branches and introducing preview deployments. The current ongoing task involves a significant refactor and enhancement of the Admin Product Management page to include an interactive form modal for adding and editing products.

Auraa Luxury aims to be a high-end dropshipping e-commerce store for accessories. The application requires full e-commerce capabilities, an admin dashboard, and future integrations with AliExpress/Amazon. Key features implemented or in progress include a luxurious UI (gold/silver/black palette, multi-line logo), multi-language (Arabic/English, extended to other languages) and multi-currency (USD/SAR, extended to GCC) support with dynamic RTL/LTR, responsive design, a refined navigation with Shop by Category, and a full-width image carousel. Free Shipping is now in the footer. Simulated external store links and dummy products were removed. The comprehensive Admin Suite now includes pages for Products (with CRUD), Orders, Users, Settings, Analytics, and Integrations. Other recent additions include advanced search and filtering with AI, smart product recommendations, product comparison, PWA support, live chat, and a fully functional wishlist feature across product displays and a dedicated page. All new features are developed behind feature flags for controlled rollout. Automatic currency conversion to USD for final payment is a standing requirement.
