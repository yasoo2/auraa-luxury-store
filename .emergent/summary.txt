The AI engineer's trajectory involved extensive full-stack development, focusing on critical fixes and feature enhancements for the Auraa Luxury e-commerce platform. Initial efforts concentrated on resolving Cloudflare Pages build failures, stemming from ESLint dependency conflicts and  issues. This led to the creation of  and removal of , followed by persistent GitHub push errors (500, 403) that were eventually resolved by switching to a Classic GitHub Personal Access Token. Concurrently, the engineer addressed a  error on the  endpoint, revealing a flaw in the CJ Dropshipping API integration that expected  for a synchronous operation. This prompted the implementation of a robust asynchronous background import system with progress tracking. A user request for persistent sessions led to setting a long JWT expiry and  token storage, which was quickly rolled back due to security concerns. The engineer then meticulously re-implemented a secure authentication system using refresh tokens,  cookies, and an Axios interceptor for automated token refreshing on  errors. The most recent task involves a comprehensive overhaul of the Quick Import page, integrating new backend endpoints for health checks and background imports with real-time progress tracking, and refactoring frontend Axios configurations to resolve persistent  errors. The current state is debugging persistent  errors related to Axios base URL.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing persistent authentication issues ( errors) reported by the user, specifically on admin endpoints like , even after implementing the secure authentication system with refresh tokens and HttpOnly cookies. The problem description also indicated a  message, suggesting connectivity or configuration issues.

The AI engineer's most recent action (Chat Message 527) was to diagnose that  might be causing CORS-related problems in the frontend's Axios configuration, and planned to fix it. This indicates that despite the comprehensive secure authentication implementation (backend and frontend), and the Quick Import page overhaul, some fundamental API communication or authentication handshake is still failing between the frontend and backend, particularly for credentialed requests. The backend health and readiness checks were passing at one point, but the latest user report shows health check failures, which needs immediate attention.

<optional_next_step>
Fix the  configuration in  to resolve persistent  errors and  messages.
