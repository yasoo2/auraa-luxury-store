# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "✅ CART COUNTER FUNCTIONALITY TESTING COMPLETE: Comprehensive testing confirms the CartContext implementation is working perfectly. 1) ✅ Admin login successful (admin@auraa.com/admin123) with 'إدارة' button visible in navbar. 2) ✅ Initial cart count display: Cart badge shows current count (started at 6, then 7 after adding). 3) ✅ Add to cart functionality: Clicking 'أضف للسلة' button successfully adds products - cart count increased from 6 to 7 with real-time update in navbar. Network logs show POST /api/cart/add returning 200 followed by GET /api/cart to refresh count. 4) ✅ Cart page functionality: Cart page loads correctly showing 4 items, with proper product details and remove buttons. 5) ✅ Remove from cart functionality: Clicking remove button successfully removes items - cart count decreased from 7 to 5 with real-time update. Network logs show DELETE /api/cart/remove returning 200 followed by GET /api/cart to refresh count. 6) ✅ Cart state synchronization: Cart count remains consistent across all pages (products page: 5, homepage: 5) - state is properly synchronized between pages. 7) ✅ Real-time updates: CartContext properly calls fetchCartCount() after add/remove operations, ensuring navbar badge updates immediately. 8) ✅ API integration: All cart endpoints working correctly (/api/cart GET, /api/cart/add POST, /api/cart/remove DELETE). The previous issue where cart count wasn't updating has been completely resolved with the new CartContext implementation."
