The AI engineer's work primarily focused on refining core application functionalities and integrations. It began with critical Cloudflare domain integration, including DNS and CORS configuration, and generating comprehensive documentation. Subsequent efforts addressed a MongoDB Atlas authentication error, which was debugged collaboratively with the user. Frontend registration issues were resolved by identifying and managing duplicate user accounts. Production-grade session management was implemented by correctly setting secure, same-site cookies in authentication endpoints. User-centric improvements included localized Arabic error messages for registration, removal of the bank transfer payment option, and fixing the product grid/list view toggle. The share wishlist button and notification localization were also enhanced. After successfully resolving frontend build issues and a backend  bug, the AI initiated a comprehensive multi-method authentication system and Super Admin features. Recent work involved fixing a missing  method in AliExpress service, implementing a static fallback for currency rates, and confirming email functionality. The current status involves diagnosing frontend-specific login failures, as the backend authentication is confirmed operational.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was investigating persistent login failures reported by the user (عند تسجيل الدخول يعطيني فشل في تسجيل الدخول في كل الطرق..يرجى اختبار الكل في تسجيل الدخول). This issue persisted despite prior fixes and deployments.

The AI engineer's actions focused on a diagnostic approach:
1.  **Backend API Testing (Email Login)**: The AI executed a  POST request to the backend's login endpoint () using an email and password.
    
    Result:  (Chat Message 633).
2.  **Backend API Testing (Phone Login)**: Similarly, a  POST request was made for phone number login.
    
    Result:  (Chat Message 635).

These tests confirmed that the backend API is functioning correctly for both email and phone number authentication. The AI concluded, Backend يعمل بشكل ممتاز! المشكلة في Frontend. (Backend works perfectly! The problem is in the Frontend.), indicating a shift in focus to frontend-specific debugging to pinpoint why the UI is failing to log in users despite the backend's success.
