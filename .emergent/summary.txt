The AI engineer's work began by confirming the overall development plan with the user, covering payment, notifications, and translation, and identifying Payoneer as the payment method. After restoring a truncated  from a backup and fixing a syntax error, core functionalities were extended. Dynamic shipping estimates were successfully integrated into the Cart Page. The backend was updated with an SSE endpoint for live import progress, and new admin dashboard modules (CMS Pages, Media Library, Theme Customization, General Settings) were added to the frontend with corresponding backend API endpoints, including updates to the image upload process. The Admin Dashboard UI was also updated to link these new pages. However, the work culminated in the user reporting missing tools in the admin panel and build errors, despite the AI engineer confirming the code and files for these tools existed. The current focus is on debugging these reported build errors and the non-display of admin dashboard elements, particularly the sidebar.

Auraa Luxury is an e-commerce platform for high-end accessories, aiming for a luxurious, responsive UI with full multi-language (Arabic/English, Turkish, Hindi, Hebrew, Spanish, French, Russian, German) and multi-currency support, including RTL/LTR. It requires a robust Admin Suite for product/order/user CRUD, analytics, and integrations, concealing sourcing details from customers while supporting multiple suppliers. Advanced features like AI search, smart recommendations, product comparison, PWA, and live chat are planned.

**Implemented So Far:** Authentication, automated CI/CD, responsive design, full AliExpress dropshipping (price/stock/shipping sync, country-specific pricing/VAT, Quick Import with supplier selection, 1000 product import with markup/tax/customs/shipping), Wishlist, Admin Dashboard access, basic legal pages, Customer Order Tracking, dynamic AliExpress shipping cost/duration estimates on product/checkout pages (with 10% markup), live progress for quick product import, and frontend/backend localization for product name/description. Payoneer was selected for payment, with email/WhatsApp notifications for later.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer had completed several tasks. It successfully added dynamic shipping estimates to the  by adapting the logic from , including country detection and API calls to . On the backend, an SSE endpoint () was created in  to stream live import progress, following the existing polling mechanism. Furthermore, three new admin dashboard components (, , ) were created, and  was updated to include navigation links to them. Corresponding backend API endpoints for these admin features were added to , and the existing  endpoint was modified to save media records. The services (backend and frontend) were restarted, and initial frontend compilation looked good with warnings. The homepage loaded correctly, and backend tests confirmed the new API endpoints were working. However, the user subsequently reported that many admin tools were missing and indicated build errors. The AI engineer investigated, confirmed the admin page components and their routes exist in the code, but screenshots revealed the admin sidebar was not rendering, and there were redirects for non-authenticated/non-admin users. The current state is that there are unaddressed build errors preventing the proper display and functionality of the admin dashboard, despite the new features being implemented in the codebase.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the reported frontend build errors that are preventing the admin dashboard from rendering correctly.
