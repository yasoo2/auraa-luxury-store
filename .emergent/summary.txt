The AI engineer's work involved extensive debugging and feature development for the Auraa Luxury e-commerce platform. Initially, the focus was on diagnosing persistent login failures, which led to identifying and rectifying a  mismatch affecting the deployed frontend. This transitioned into resolving hardcoded Arabic text in the UI for proper multi-language support. Subsequently, the registration flow was enhanced to allow users to register with either email or phone, not necessarily both. The most significant development was the creation of a comprehensive Super Admin management page, including role changes, password resets, and user activation/deletion functionalities. Additionally, a date conversion utility was implemented to display Hijri dates for Arabic users. The trajectory concludes with the Super Admin page partially functional, but the Statistics API endpoint returning a 500 error, which needs immediate attention.

<product_requirements>
Auraa Luxury is an e-commerce platform for high-end accessories with a luxurious, responsive UI, multi-language (Arabic, English, Turkish, Hindi, Hebrew, Spanish, French, Russian, German) and multi-currency support, including RTL/LTR. It requires a robust Admin Suite for product/order/user CRUD, analytics, and integrations, abstracting supplier details, and supporting multiple vendors. Implemented features include authentication, automated CI/CD, responsive design, AliExpress dropshipping (price/stock/shipping sync, country-specific pricing/VAT, Quick Import with live progress tracking via SSE), Wishlist, Admin Dashboard (CMS/Media/Theme Customization), legal pages, Customer Order Tracking, dynamic AliExpress shipping (with 10% markup), frontend/backend localization, and Payoneer selected for payments (not integrated). Recent additions include AliExpress S2S Tracking endpoints, Google Analytics 4 (GA4), a dynamic sitemap, a complete Gmail SMTP email system, updated contact info, Cloudflare integration for domain management, and a comprehensive multi-method authentication system (Email/Phone/Google/Facebook/Twitter, password reset, delete account, Super Admin management).
Recent developments included:
1.  **Flexible Registration:** Users can register using either email or phone number, or both optionally.
2.  **Super Admin Management Page:** A dedicated admin page for Super Admins to view, manage (change roles, reset passwords, activate/deactivate, delete), and gather statistics on Admin and User accounts.
3.  **Date Localization:** Automatic conversion of Gregorian dates to Hijri dates when the Arabic language is selected, applied across various pages.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was continuing to debug and refine the newly implemented Super Admin Management page. The user had reported persistent issues (عند تسجيل الدخول بواسطة السوبر ادمن يعطيني فشل في تحميل المسؤولين ولا يوجد بيانات عن الادمن ولا اليوزرز ويجب ان يعطيني اسم اليوزر الذي استخدمه حاليا وامكانية تغير الاسم والباسورد وتحويله من سوبر ادمن الى ادمن وبالعكس).

The AI engineer's actions involved:
1.  **Backend Endpoint Refinement:** Moved  related API endpoints (like list, change role, reset password, toggle status, delete) directly into  under the  prefix to resolve routing issues that were causing 404s or other failures when the frontend attempted to fetch data.
2.  **Frontend Integration:** Updated  to correctly call these new backend endpoints with the proper URLs and authorization headers, removing earlier incorrect dependencies on  in query parameters.
3.  **UI Enhancements:** Added a dedicated section within  to display the currently logged-in Super Admin's information (name, email/phone) and provided options for changing their name and resetting their password.
4.  **Service Restart & Testing:** Restarted all services (backend, frontend) to apply changes and then performed a frontend test.

The current state is that the Super Admin Management page () now successfully loads, displays the current Super Admin's details, and lists other admin/user accounts. Basic functionalities like changing roles, resetting passwords, toggling status, and deleting users are implemented. However, the **Statistics API endpoint** (presumably for ,  etc.) is still returning a **500 Internal Server Error**, which is the immediate outstanding issue.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the 500 error for the Statistics API endpoint on the Admin Management page.
