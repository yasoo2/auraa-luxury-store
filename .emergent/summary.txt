The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles the development and extensive debugging of the Auraa Luxury e-commerce application. Initially, the focus was on core Admin Suite features, user experience enhancements (e.g., advanced search, recommendations, wishlist), and a critical wishlist bug fix. The primary challenge throughout the provided trajectory, however, revolved around persistent Vercel deployment failures. The AI engineer meticulously addressed  and  syntax errors, conflicting file structures, and incorrect build configurations. This involved multiple iterations of simplification, dependency adjustments, and alignment with Vercel's expected build processes. Concurrently, a cart counter bug and carousel image updates were successfully implemented. Later, the CI/CD pipeline was configured following user specifications. Despite repeated local build successes and extensive file sanitation, deployment issues, particularly a  compilation error, persisted. This led to the agent creating a drastically simplified frontend to isolate the problem, which also faced deployment issues. The current state is a barebones React application, struggling with Vercel deployment, with the last interaction indicating that the latest local fixes were not yet deployed to GitHub for Vercel to pick up.

<product_requirements>
Auraa Luxury is designed as a high-end dropshipping e-commerce platform for accessories, requiring comprehensive e-commerce functionalities, an admin dashboard, and future integrations with AliExpress/Amazon. Key features include a luxurious UI with a gold/silver/black palette and a multi-line logo, full multi-language (Arabic/English, extended to GCC) and multi-currency support with dynamic RTL/LTR, responsive design, and refined navigation. Implemented features include a full-width image carousel, Free Shipping in the footer, removal of simulated external store links, and a comprehensive Admin Suite with CRUD for Products, Orders, Users, Settings, Analytics, and Integrations. Recent additions cover advanced search with AI, smart product recommendations, product comparison, PWA support, live chat, and a fully functional wishlist, all behind feature flags. A standing requirement is automatic currency conversion to USD for final payment.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving persistent deployment failures on Vercel, which manifested as Unexpected end of JSON input for  and  errors, specifically for . Extensive efforts were made to simplify and validate  (reducing size, ensuring correct JSON termination, adding ),  (setting , ), and  (aligning with Vercel Deploy Hook specifications). The  in  was correctly set to the production Render URL.

To bypass the  build error and isolate the Vercel build system, the  was drastically simplified to a barebones component (effectively a Deployment Test page), and  was removed from . Supporting files like  and  were also simplified. This minimal setup successfully built locally.

However, the user reported that the deployment was still failing on Vercel. The last interaction involved the user asking ما المشكلة (What is the problem), and the AI engineer noting internally that the التغييرات لم ترفع بعد (Changes not pushed yet). This indicates that despite all local fixes and simplifications, the latest working code has not been synchronized with GitHub, which is necessary to trigger a new Vercel deployment. The core task is to get a functional application deployed, and the current obstacle is the synchronization of the latest (simplified) codebase to the remote repository for Vercel to pick up.
