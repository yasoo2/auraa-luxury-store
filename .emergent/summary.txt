The AI engineer's trajectory details the Lora Luxury e-commerce application's development, moving from initial setup to significant feature enhancements and extensive debugging. The initial focus was on overcoming persistent Vercel deployment failures, involving iterative fixes to , , and  to isolate and resolve  build issues. Following local build success, the engineer implemented major UI improvements, including a luxurious homepage carousel with 10 model images, refined CSS animations, and a redesigned, elegant authentication page. Critical fixes were made to the admin login flow, addressing  logic,  function usage, and form submission issues. The system for automatic updates (currency, product sync) was developed, alongside a deployment setup endpoint for easier Vercel initialization. The brand name was globally updated from Auraa Luxury to Lora Luxury. Recent efforts focused on responsive design, mandatory phone fields, and resolving a lingering admin login failure, culminating in a fully functional, aesthetically enhanced application. The final pending item is to verify the automated GitHub-to-Vercel deployment.

Lora Luxury is a high-end dropshipping e-commerce platform for accessories, aiming for a luxurious UI (gold/silver/black palette, multi-line logo), full multi-language (Arabic/English, GCC focus) and multi-currency support with dynamic RTL/LTR, and responsive design. Core features include a full-width image carousel (recently updated with 10 luxury model images and animations), Free Shipping footer, removed external store links, and a comprehensive Admin Suite with CRUD for products, orders, users, settings, analytics, and integrations. Advanced features like AI search, smart recommendations, product comparison, PWA, live chat, and a functional wishlist are behind feature flags. Key implementations include a refined authentication page, automatic currency conversion, product synchronization (AliExpress/Amazon integration planned), bulk import, and an automated CI/CD pipeline. The brand name was updated from Auraa Luxury to Lora Luxury, with the requirement for it to be consistently English. Mandatory phone number input for registration was also implemented.
