# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Network logs show POST /api/cart/add returning 200 followed by GET /api/cart to refresh count. 4) ✅ Cart page functionality: Cart page loads correctly showing 4 items, with proper product details and remove buttons. 5) ✅ Remove from cart functionality: Clicking remove button successfully removes items - cart count decreased from 7 to 5 with real-time update. Network logs show DELETE /api/cart/remove returning 200 followed by GET /api/cart to refresh count. 6) ✅ Cart state synchronization: Cart count remains consistent across all pages (products page: 5, homepage: 5) - state is properly synchronized between pages. 7) ✅ Real-time updates: CartContext properly calls fetchCartCount() after add/remove operations, ensuring navbar badge updates immediately. 8) ✅ API integration: All cart endpoints working correctly (/api/cart GET, /api/cart/add POST, /api/cart/remove DELETE). The previous issue where cart count wasn't updating has been completely resolved with the new CartContext implementation."

    message: "🔐 ADMIN AUTHENTICATION DEBUG TESTING COMPLETE: Executed comprehensive admin authentication flow testing specifically to debug frontend admin button visibility issue. DETAILED FINDINGS: 1) Backend admin authentication working perfectly - POST /api/auth/login with admin@auraa.com/admin123 returns HTTP 200. 2) Response structure complete: access_token (165 chars), token_type: 'bearer', user object with is_admin: true, email: 'admin@auraa.com', id: 'd4590e23-2107-46d2-9666-4519fa530eb9'. 3) Token functionality verified: /auth/me endpoint returns 200 with is_admin: true, /admin/integrations returns 200, admin product CRUD operations work (create/delete tested successfully). 4) All 42 backend API tests passed (100% success rate). CONCLUSION: Backend is functioning correctly and returning proper admin user data with is_admin flag set to true. The frontend admin button visibility issue is NOT a backend problem. Recommend checking: 1) Frontend AuthContext state management, 2) Admin button visibility logic checking user.is_admin flag, 3) React component re-rendering after login, 4) Local storage/session persistence of admin status."
