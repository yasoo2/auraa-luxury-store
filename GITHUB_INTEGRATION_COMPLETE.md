## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Cloudflare Pages (Will Auto-Build Now)
Since GitHub is now connected and commits are being pushed:
- Cloudflare Pages will automatically detect new commits
- A new build will trigger on every push to `main`
- Check build status at: Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → Your Project

### 2. Verify Build Configuration
Ensure these settings in Cloudflare Pages:

**Build Settings:**
```
Root directory: /
Build command: cd frontend && npm ci --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build
Output directory: frontend/build
```

**Environment Variables:**
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://api.auraaluxury.com
REACT_APP_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=0x4AAAAAAB7WqGc00XxvDASQ4
NODE_VERSION=18
DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true
```

### 3. Complete DNS Setup
Refer to: `/app/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

**Required CNAME Records:**
```
@ → auraa-luxury-store-v2.pages.dev (Proxied)
www → auraa-luxury-store-v2.pages.dev (Proxied)
api → auraa-luxury-store.onrender.com (Proxied)
```

### 4. Configure Render Backend
- Add custom domain: `api.auraaluxury.com`
- Update CORS_ORIGINS environment variable
- Restart service

## 🔧 Future Git Operations

### Pushing Changes
All future changes will be automatically pushed when you:
1. Make code changes in the environment
2. Use "Save to GitHub" button (should work now)
3. Commits will trigger Cloudflare Pages builds automatically

### Manual Push (if needed)
```bash
cd /app
git add -A
git commit -m "your commit message"
git push origin main
```
