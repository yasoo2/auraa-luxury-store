The AI engineer's trajectory began with debugging reported frontend build errors and missing admin tools. Initial fixes involved resolving an undefined  in  and a redirection issue in  due to asynchronous authentication checks. After confirming the admin panel and its new pages (CMS, Media, Theme Customization) were accessible, the focus shifted to a user-reported admin login failure, which was resolved by creating the default admin user in the database.

Subsequently, the user reported an issue with  automatically re-importing 1000 products, which led to reducing the default count to 500 and implementing the actual product import logic in , as it was previously a placeholder. This required fixing an  error. Further debugging revealed products were importing but not appearing, leading to a fix for category casing and finally confirming products were correctly stored in .

The next major task was to integrate real AliExpress products. Initial attempts revealed invalid API keys, prompting a discussion about using AliExpress Affiliate vs. Dropshipping APIs. The user opted for a hybrid approach. The AI engineer attempted to implement the Affiliate API but encountered an access issue. Then, the user reported a UI bug with transparent dropdowns, which was addressed by adding specific CSS rules.

The conversation then returned to frontend build issues, which the AI engineer classified as warnings and confirmed the build success locally. Finally, the user provided a detailed specification for AliExpress S2S Tracking. The AI engineer adapted this Node.js specification to the existing FastAPI backend by creating data models, adding API endpoints, and documenting the process, but encountered a backend startup failure during testing.

<product_requirements>
Auraa Luxury is an e-commerce platform for high-end accessories, emphasizing a luxurious, responsive UI with comprehensive multi-language (Arabic/English, Turkish, Hindi, Hebrew, Spanish, French, Russian, German) and multi-currency support, including RTL/LTR. It demands a robust Admin Suite for product/order/user CRUD, analytics, and integrations, while abstracting supplier details from customers and supporting multiple vendors. Future plans include AI search, smart recommendations, product comparison, PWA, and live chat.

**Implemented So Far:** The platform features authentication, automated CI/CD, responsive design, full AliExpress dropshipping capabilities (including price/stock/shipping sync, country-specific pricing/VAT, Quick Import with supplier selection, 1000 product import with markup/tax/customs/shipping), Wishlist functionality, Admin Dashboard access with basic legal pages, Customer Order Tracking, dynamic AliExpress shipping cost/duration estimates on product/checkout pages (with a 10% markup), and live progress tracking for quick product imports. Frontend and backend localization for product name/description is also in place. Payoneer has been selected for payment processing, with email/WhatsApp notifications slated for later implementation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was implementing AliExpress Server-to-Server (S2S) Tracking based on a detailed specification provided by the user. This involved adapting a Node.js-based plan to the existing FastAPI (Python) backend. The work completed includes:

1.  **Backend Model Creation**: A new Pydantic model () was created to represent AliExpress conversion data for the S2S postback.
2.  **API Endpoint Addition**: The main  file was modified to include new API endpoints:
    *   : A GET endpoint designed to receive conversion data from AliExpress (e.g., , , ).
    *   : An optional GET endpoint intended to generate a  and redirect to an AliExpress affiliate link, injecting the  for tracking.
3.  **Dependency Imports**: Necessary imports, such as  models and potentially other utilities for the new endpoints, were added to .
4.  **Documentation**: A new Markdown file () was created to document the S2S tracking system, including setup instructions, environment variables, data models, and API usage.

After these modifications, the backend service was restarted (, ), but the subsequent check resulted in a Command execution failed error (Chat Message 616). The current state is that the S2S tracking feature is partially implemented on the backend, but the service is failing to restart correctly, preventing further testing or development.
