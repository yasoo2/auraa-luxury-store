<analysis>
The AI engineer's work trajectory for the Auraa Luxury e-commerce application covers significant feature development and persistent debugging. Initial tasks focused on verifying automated GitHub deployments and fixing mobile header responsiveness, including visibility of navigation and language selectors. Subsequently, explicit user requests led to removing Free Shipping text and ensuring the Why Auraa Luxury section title consistently appeared in English. The Cash on Delivery payment option was entirely removed due to the dropshipping model. A critical phase involved correcting the brand name from Lora back to Auraa across the frontend and extensively expanding multi-currency support to include 22 global currencies. Following this, a comprehensive product management system was integrated, linking  to  with CRUD operations and image upload functionality, alongside backend API endpoints. Placeholder AliExpress integration, bulk import, and user/order management pages were created and integrated into the admin dashboard. Numerous JavaScript errors due to duplicate variable declarations were debugged and resolved. The most recent efforts are dedicated to making the entire website fully responsive across phones, tablets, and laptops, specifically enhancing the homepage, product pages, and carousel components. Persistent issues with cached content on the user's preview environment required multiple full system restarts and cache clearing.

Auraa Luxury is a high-end dropshipping e-commerce platform specializing in accessories. The vision includes a luxurious UI with a gold/silver/black palette and multi-line logo, full multi-language (Arabic/English, GCC focus) and multi-currency support (now expanded to 22 global currencies) with dynamic RTL/LTR, and comprehensive responsive design across all devices. Core features entail a full-width image carousel (updated with 10 luxury model images and animations), and a robust Admin Suite for CRUD operations on products, orders, users, settings, analytics, and integrations. Advanced functionalities like AI search, smart recommendations, product comparison, PWA, live chat, and wishlist are feature-flagged. Key implementations include a refined authentication page with mandatory phone number input, automatic currency conversion, product synchronization (AliExpress/Amazon integration planned, currently a placeholder), bulk import capabilities, and an automated CI/CD pipeline. The brand name was established as Auraa Luxury (always English). Free Shipping text and Cash on Delivery were removed to align with the dropshipping model.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing comprehensive responsive design for the Auraa Luxury e-commerce application across various device types (phones, tablets, laptops). This involved systematic modifications to several frontend components.
Specifically, changes were made to:
*   ****: Enhanced responsiveness for the main hero section and the Why Auraa Luxury section, adjusting layouts and text sizes for mobile.
*   ****: Improved responsiveness for product listings, including the display of filters (with a mobile toggle) and the grid layout for products. Image sizes within the product grid were also adjusted for smaller screens.
*   ****: Optimized for mobile responsiveness, adjusting the sizing and positioning of the carousel title, description, and Shop Now button.
The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer in the process of improving the navigation buttons within the carousel for mobile devices. This work is part of a broader effort to ensure the entire website is portable to all phone types, tablets, laptops as requested by the user.
