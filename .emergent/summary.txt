The trajectory details the iterative development of Auraa Luxury, transforming an MVP into a sophisticated e-commerce platform. Initial efforts focused on scaffolding the core application (FastAPI/React/MongoDB), establishing a luxurious UI with multi-language and multi-currency support, and resolving early deployment hurdles on Vercel. Subsequent phases involved extensive UI/UX refinements, including meticulous logo adjustments, dynamic image handling for the carousel, and robust internationalization. A significant portion of the work addressed Vercel build failures related to dependency conflicts and  configurations. The most recent and ongoing task is the development of a comprehensive Admin Suite, commencing with backend product CRUD APIs and the foundational frontend dashboard components, ensuring all changes are made behind feature flags for safe deployment and controlled rollout.

The goal is Auraa Luxury, a high-end dropshipping e-commerce store for accessories with full e-commerce functionality, an admin dashboard, and future live AliExpress/Amazon integrations. Implemented features include a luxurious UI (gold/silver/black palette, multi-line logo), multi-language (Arabic/English, extended to other languages) and multi-currency (USD/SAR, extended to GCC) support with dynamic RTL/LTR, responsive design, a refined navigation with Shop by Category, and a full-width image carousel displaying models with accessories. Free Shipping is in the footer. Simulated external store links and dummy products are removed. Current focus is a comprehensive Admin Suite for managing products, orders, users, pages, theme, media, and integrations, alongside full i18n, responsive image handling, SEO, performance, and UX improvements, all feature-flagged. Automatic currency conversion to USD for final payment is required.
