The AI engineer's trajectory involved several distinct phases. Initially, it focused on establishing core e-commerce functionalities like legal pages and customer order tracking, along with fixing minor UI issues. A significant portion was dedicated to evolving the AliExpress dropshipping integration, moving towards dynamic shipping cost/duration calculations and robust multi-language/multi-currency support. Concurrently, the engineer improved the admin experience by adding live import progress feedback. Throughout, the focus shifted from foundational elements to advanced internationalization and user experience enhancements, culminating in a proposed comprehensive roadmap for a perfect store addressing payment, notifications, and further platform refinements. The work demonstrates an iterative approach, frequently seeking user confirmation and adapting to evolving requirements.

Auraa Luxury is a high-end dropshipping e-commerce platform for accessories, requiring a luxurious UI, full multi-language (Arabic/English, GCC focus, expanding to Turkish, Hindi, Hebrew, Spanish, French, Russian, German) and multi-currency support with dynamic RTL/LTR. It needs comprehensive responsive design and a robust Admin Suite for product/order/user CRUD, analytics, and integrations. The platform should hide product sourcing details from customers and support multiple suppliers. Advanced features like AI search, smart recommendations, product comparison, PWA, and live chat are planned.

**Implemented So Far:**
- Refined authentication, automatic currency conversion, automated CI/CD pipeline.
- Responsive design for homepage, product pages, carousel.
- Full AliExpress dropshipping integration with automatic price/stock/shipping synchronization (every 10 minutes), country-specific pricing/VAT, Quick Import Admin UI with supplier type selection, and automatic import of 1000 products with 100% price markup, tax, customs, and shipping time.
- Wishlist functionality, Admin Dashboard accessibility.
- Basic legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Return Policy, Contact Us).
- Customer Order Tracking page with internal tracking events.
- Dynamic shipping cost and duration estimation from AliExpress based on buyer's country, incorporating a 10% markup, displayed on product and checkout pages, blocking checkout if unavailable.
- Live progress percentage for quick product import.
- Frontend and backend support for product name/description localization based on user's selected language.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's overarching request to make the store perfect and implement everything. The engineer proposed a comprehensive roadmap in four phases (A: Core Perfection, B: Shipping & Payment, C: Admin & Content, D: Advanced Experience). This roadmap outlined steps for full multi-language support (including backend localization of products), consistent server-side currency, Gregorian dates, dynamic AliExpress shipping (already partially implemented with 10% markup on Checkout and Product Detail pages), payment gateway integration, live import progress (polling implemented, SSE proposed), and various admin/advanced features. The AI engineer is awaiting user confirmation on specific choices for Payment Gateway, Notification providers, Translation strategy, and whether to proceed with SSE implementation for live import progress. The very last action was presenting this detailed plan and asking the user to make these crucial prioritization decisions.
